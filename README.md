# TastyWorld (MealDB)

## What does my aplication do?

My application provides users with a list of recipes classified by categories, such as from a region of the world.
Once the user chooses a recipe, they will have the main ingredients and step-by-step section to
prepare it at home.
To avoid that users don't lose their recipes, they have the chance to added them as favourites by clicking on the heart Add Favourites to see them at any time.

## Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- React JS
- Vite


## Why did I used these technologies?

- Tailwind provided me a quick customisation of styles,
easy to install and use, recommended to anyone who hasn't used it before.

- React gave me the chance to make more clear my code to organise various functionalities into components.

- Vite offered me a quick response time to launch my project up and running.
